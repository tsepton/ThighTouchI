# User inputs
This folder contains user inputs that were recorded during the experiment. A script is also available to concat multiple files in one in order to visualize its heatmap (see the [analytics app](../../analytics-app/)).

## Script Requirement
Make sure you have node (or whatever JavaScript runtime environment you like) installed. 
```bash
node concat_all.js <substring to filter out files>
```
