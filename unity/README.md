# Experiment Application

This folder contains the unity project that was used to create the user experiment, as well as the tutorial. 

## Building the App
1. Open the project using Unity (version used was 2022.3.14.f1).
2. Open each scene, and update the device's IP address by updating the Touchpad component on the ThighToughI/Touchpad gameobject. 
3. Build the project. Make sure to include all scenes, starting by the one called SceneLoader. 
4. Deploy on the Quest 3.
